## Lecture Notes

What you need to know for your quiz/homework/midterm:

1. subqueries
    1. section 7 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. compared to joins (power):
        1. every join can be written as a cross join + subquery
        1. some subqueries can be written as joins
        1. a subquery cannot be written as a join if it contains an aggregate function
    1. compared to joins (general):
        1. subqueries are easier for beginners to understand than joins
        1. joins are easier for experts to understand
        1. there is no performance difference (in theory)
    1. alternative reference on subqueries vs joins: <https://learnsql.com/blog/subquery-vs-join/>

1. set operations
    1. section 5 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. most important operation is `union` vs `union all`

1. joins
    1. sections 3 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. the "standard" explanation of joins uses venn diagrams, but this is technically not correct since relations are not sets; see: <https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/>

    1. if this all seems weird/hard/confusing... that's because it is

1. arrays
    1. postgresql specific extension, not on quiz
    1. a "denormalized" method for storing join tables
        1. there's speed/memory tradeoffs between different representations which we'll talk about later
        1. for now, just focus on using arrays to get the right answer
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-array/
    1. `unnest` is the only array function you'll want to use (for this week's homework)

We will not cover the following topics in class (but you need to know for homework):

1. section 6 of <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/>
    1. syntactic sugar for complicated GROUP BY clauses
    1. good to know, but they're not "hard" concepts
    1. "less technical" technical interviews often ask about these topics

1. window functions <https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-window-function/>
    1. later homework problems walk you through some basic usage

<!--
1. `CREATE TABLE`
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-create-table/
    1. https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-data-types/
    1. Examples in the tutorial use `VARCHAR`, but you shouldn't use this type in postgresql.
       Instead, you should use the `TEXT` type.
       See: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_varchar.28n.29_by_default

1. `INSERT` / `UPDATE` / `DELETE`
    1. <img src=Strip-Bas-ed-eonnée-effacée-650-finalenglish.jpg width=60%/>
    1. sections 9 of https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/
